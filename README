The code matrix_operations.py offers 2 functions: (1) multiply to multiply two matrices, both of size [n,n] and largest_element to find the largest element in a given matrix of size [n,n].

Both of the provdided functions have bugs. To debug, form a team of 2 members. Each member needs to debug one of the functions on their laptop. As a team, you then need to upload the corrected code to one of the team members github repository.

1) Each member should clone the repository on their laptop with
$ git clone https://github.com/amberj87/CH603_codes_with_bugs
This will create a new folder CH603_codes_with_bugs. cd to this folder.

## IMPORTANT STEP
2) Create a new github repository on one team member's account. Direct the remote origin to this new repository and push to this local repository
$ git remote set-url origin https:<link to the new github repo>
$ git remote -v  ## Make sure the path lister is for the newly created github repository
$ git push -u origin master
Check if the code is now visible on your newly created github repository

3) Create a new branch on your laptop to debug
$ git checkout -b debug

4) Each member should choose one of the functions to debug. After debugging and running python3 matrix_operations.py to make sure your function works, commit the changes (git add and git commit)

5) Change back to the master branch (git checkout master)

6) Merge with the debug branch (git merge debug)

7) git pull to resolve conflicts with the code on github repository

8) git push -u origin master to push your code into the repository
